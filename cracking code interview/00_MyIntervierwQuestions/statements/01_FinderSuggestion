Imagine your team have to implement a finder and your task is to implements the searches suggestions.
Basically, the problem is, getting an input string (it can be a complete or a partial word), you have to find and retrieve any posibble word to show as a suggestion to user.

The input will be an string.
The output will be an array with the suggestions.

How would you implement it?
